This is a personal repository dedicated to the study of the [Deoxys](https://github.com/kasarlabs/deoxys) repository for development purposes. It meant **by no means** as an exaustive guide (please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.madara.zone/ecosystem/deoxys) instead), but might turn into a more substantial form of documentation eventually.
