> ⚠️ Don't think of Substrate in analogy to linear program execution. Do not even think of it in term of a `main` program execution structure! Substrate is much closer to a DSL / Domain-Specific-Framework: it is best though of in terms of interoperable modules which communicate with each other to achieve multiple functionalities, such as block signing and creation, consensus mechanisms, p2p... When trying to modify a part of Deoxys, do not look for a single unified source of execution, but rather for the module providing that functionality.
